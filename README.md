# project smart_play_set
The smart play sets project focuses on the early detection of derailment of the healthy development of motor skills in primary school children through smart play sets (e.g. the futurocube, http://www.futurocube.com/).

The following parties are involved in the project 1) Digital Life Centre at HvA; 2) NYOYN, a creative company in Interactive Play products; 3) The Interaction & Play lab, a research group at HvA in the Digital Media and Creative Industry domain; 4) Knowledge Center for movement, sport & nutrition at HvA (http://www.hva.nl/mambo/). 

The play sets are on the one hand capable to provide a high level diagnosis through sensor-captured data and on the other hand to engage children in physical activities that are fun to do and offer relevant exercises for care and cure. Through the use of these play sets in physical education, the children develop and train their motor abilities. During play the device sensors measure movement using accelerometers and a gyroscope. 

The system to be build will be mapping sensor readings from the play devices to an assessment of the motor skills of the child playing a game. This assessment is used to generate a report on the child's progress for the teacher and to provide direct feedback to the child by steering the course of the game in such a way that the child gets to exercise the relevant motor skills.

The first experiments were held in September 2016 and the preliminary version of the resport can be found [here](https://github.com/toologicbv/smart_play_set/blob/master/docs/smart_play_set_paper_v5.pdf)
